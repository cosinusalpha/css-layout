# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing! Small projects move faster with clear guidance.

How to contribute

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a descriptive branch: `feature/your-feature` or `fix/issue-description`.
3. Run tests locally: `npm ci && npm run test:runtime`.
4. Open a Pull Request against `main` with a clear description and screenshots if relevant.

Coding style

- Use modern ES modules and prefer small, well-tested changes.
- Keep UI changes accessible by default (ARIA attributes where appropriate).

Reporting bugs & requesting features

- Open an issue with steps to reproduce and expected vs actual behavior.
- Include screenshots and a minimal reproduction if possible.
