# Visual CSS Layout Designer

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to create a web-based, visual tool for designing CSS Flexbox and Grid layouts. The application should provide an intuitive interface for users to build complex, responsive web layouts without writing code directly. It should then generate the corresponding HTML and CSS (or Tailwind CSS) that can be used in any web project.

## Implemented Features

*   **Visual Layout Editor:** A canvas where users can add and nest `row` and `column` elements to build a layout structure.
*   **Live Preview:** A real-time preview of the layout that shows how it will look on different devices. Users can switch between:
    *   Desktop
    *   Tablet
    *   Mobile
*   **Properties Panel:** When an element on the canvas is selected, a properties panel appears, allowing the user to modify its CSS properties. This includes:
    *   **Responsive Styling:** A tabbed interface to apply different styles for desktop, tablet, and mobile screen sizes.
    *   **Layout Properties:** Controls for `width`, `height`, `flex-grow`, `margin`, `padding`, `flex-direction`, `justify-content`, and `align-items`.
*   **Code Generation:** The ability to generate the final HTML and CSS code for the created layout. Users can choose between:
    *   **Pure CSS:** Generates standard CSS with class names.
    *   **Tailwind CSS:** Generates HTML with the corresponding Tailwind CSS utility classes.
*   **Core Editor Features:**
    *   **Clear Canvas:** A button to clear the entire layout and start over.
    *   **Preset Layouts:** A dropdown menu with pre-built layouts (e.g., "Header, Content, Footer") that can be loaded onto the canvas as a starting point.

## Next Steps

The current application provides a solid foundation, but it could be extended with several powerful features:

*   **Save/Load Layouts:** Implement a feature to save the current layout to a local file (e.g., `layout.json`) and load it back into the editor. This would allow users to save their work and create a library of their own layouts.
*   **Grid Layout Support:** Add support for CSS Grid, including controls for grid template columns/rows, gaps, and item placement.
*   **Component Library:** Create a library of pre-built components (e.g., navbars, cards, buttons) that can be dragged and dropped onto the canvas.
*   **More CSS Properties:** Expand the properties panel with more CSS controls, such as borders, backgrounds, shadows, and typography.
*   **Improved Tailwind CSS Mapping:** The current Tailwind CSS mapping is basic. It could be expanded to support a wider range of Tailwind utilities and custom values.
*   **Undo/Redo Functionality:** Add undo and redo buttons to make the editing process more forgiving.
*   **Direct Code Editing:** Allow users to directly edit the generated HTML and CSS, with the changes reflected back on the canvas.
